Early versions were cooked on the hearth of a hot fire, or on a heated tile or earthenware disk, like the related flatbreads. Bakers often puncture the bread with a knife to relieve bubbling on the surface of the bread.',

		history: 'Pliny the Elder claimed radicchio was useful as a blood purifier and an aid for insomniacs in Naturalis Historia. In fact, radicchio contains intybin, a sedative/analgesic, as well as a type of flavonoid called anthocyanin which is used for making dye-sensitized solar cells. Modern cultivation of the plant began in the fifteenth century, in the Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Trentino regions of Italy, but the deep-red radicchio of today was engineered in 1860 by the Belgian agronomist Francesco Van den Borre, who used a technique called imbianchimento (whitening), preforcing, or blanching to create the dark red, white-veined leaves: radicchio plants are taken from the ground and placed in water in darkened sheds, where lack of light and ensuing inhibition of chlorophyll production cause the plants to lose their green pigmentation.',

		history: 'The contents of an antipasto vary greatly according to regional cuisine. It is quite possible to find different preparations of saltwater fish and traditional southern cured meats (like soppressata or \'nduja) in the south of Italy, whereas in northern Italy it will contain different kinds of cured meats and mushrooms and, especially near lakes, preparations of freshwater fish. The cheeses included also vary significantly between regions and backgrounds. Many compare antipasto to hors d\'oeuvre, but antipasto is served at the table and signifies the official beginning of the Italian meal. It may also be referred to as a starter, or an entrée.',

While this recipe certainly doesn’t skimp on the oil, I rely more on spicy red pepper, fresh herbs, and raw garlic to provide bold flavor. Rather than a traditional chunky, relish-y caponata, this one is more like a spread, due to the roasted eggplant. It’s delicious on crusty bread. I tried it out on the Italian nun who lives next door to me (seriously!). Of course, she’s not a nonna, but her approval was good enough for me.',
